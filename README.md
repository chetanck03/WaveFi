## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 2 – Unleash blockchain gameplay with Monad**

WaveFi serves as a trustless intermediary, leveraging Monad chain for transparent and secure prize distribution in competitive gaming.

## 🎯 Objective

WaveFi is a blockchain-powered play-to-earn gaming platform built on **Monad**, designed to deliver competitive skill-based gaming experiences. Players convert Monad tokens into platform points to enter game rooms, compete in mini-games, and win real rewards. Inspired by platforms like MPL and Winzo, our platform enables users to compete in simple yet engaging games with entry fees, creating prize pools where winners earn real value in Monad tokens.
